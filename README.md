# go-codegen

mono repo for set of code generators.

## codegen

code generator commands.

A swiss army knife code generator implementation for my own.

Packages under this module are exported for possible demands of reuse.
However packages might not be stable.

Dependencies are loosely controlled since it is just a code generator.
`No dep other than std` is not target for this module.

## other modules under pkg dir

runtime for the generated code.
